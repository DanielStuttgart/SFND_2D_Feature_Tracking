# Sensor Fusion Nanodegree: Camera 2D Feature Tracking
Part of Sensor Fusion Nanodegree at Udacity

## Installation and Setup
For solving all given tasks, OpenCV 4.1 and its contributions (used for SIFT, BRIK - detectors) are needed. I installed OpenCV and OpenCV_Contrib via GIT and CMake (https://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html). In Windows, the path to OpenCV needs to be added to system PATH-variable. Furthermore, an own OPENCV_DIR variable needs to be set.
